Welcome to our cool and funny project 👋💻❤️‍🔥

<b>Project Goal<b>: build a simple web application which combines knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. 

The basic idea was to build an online store to buy and sell products. We further developed this idea and we wanted to add some features as online academy where you can register on different courses and take lessons online  (watch videos and funny stuff). Then we implemented a section where users that are already registered in the database could post, comment on other posts and edit the content of their profile. It is a dynamic website, which besides a nice and interesting style it has a solid database (implemented in MySQL and phpMyAdmin) and it has a lot of functionalities waiting to be explored.
