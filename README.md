# OBTechnology

> Obsolete (not maintained) - This project is now several years old. We have grown a lot since we made this project, both as developers and as software engineers. I will keep the project in my repository as a proof of my growth. <br></br>
> We all have to start somewhere and this was our starting point. Probably there are issues inhere like SQL injection, DRY validation, Wrong Sepearation of Concerns or other principles which are not maintained, e.g. dependncy inversion or other SOLIDs. However, this was me 5 years ago (probably when someone reads this, I would be older). It has been a long jorney since then, of self-improvement, learning and long studying nights. Consider it as our first step to learn web development. Have fun! xD

## Project:

### Tech Stack: `PHP`, `HTML5`, `CSS3`, `JQuery`, `Javascript`, `MySQL`, `PHPMyAdmin`, `XaMPP`

Welcome to our cool and funny project üëãüíª‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

<b>Project Goal<b>: build a simple web application which combines knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. 

The basic idea was to build an online store to buy and sell products. We further developed this idea and we wanted to add some features as online academy where you can register on different courses and take lessons online  (watch videos and funny stuff). Then we implemented a section where users that are already registered in the database could post, comment on other posts and edit the content of their profile. It is a dynamic website, which besides a nice and interesting style it has a solid database (implemented in MySQL and phpMyAdmin) and it has a lot of functionalities waiting to be explored.
